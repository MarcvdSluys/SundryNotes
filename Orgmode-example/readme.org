#+title: Org mode example

Example of an Org mode file with exports and configuration for emacs.

* Source file

The source file is the Org mode file (~Orgmode-example.org~).  You can download and open it with emacs, which
should start ~org-mode~ because of the file extension (~.org~).

From a bash shell, do:
#+begin_src bash
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcvdSluys/SundryNotes/master/Orgmode-example/Orgmode-example.org
  emacs Orgmode-example.org &
#+end_src


* Exports

This directory also contains exported files: HTML, Markdown (~.md~), ODT, PDF, reStructured Text (~.rst~),
ascii and UTF-8 (both ~.txt~).


** Render HTML

The html file is shown in GitHub as source code, but can be shown rendered in a browser through [[https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/MarcvdSluys/SundryNotes/blob/master/Orgmode-example/Orgmode-example.html][this link]]


* Emacs configuration

Emacs settings are usually in =~/.emacs.d/init.el= (or =~/.emacs=).  My settings for Org mode can be found in
~init.el~.  You can either copy settings in line by line and see what works, or copy everything in and comment
out (~;;~) what doesn't work.  It is likely that not all will work at the first go, because some options
require additional software (e.g. emacs-packages, LaTeX) and I'm too lazy to figure this out.

Alternatively, you can rename this file e.g. ~orgmode.el~ and source it from your ~init.el~ using
#+begin_src elisp
  (load "orgmode")
#+end_src
